# linearizing-uncertainty-for-control
This code can be used to reproduce the results in our paper ``Extended Kalman filter---Koopman operator for tractable stochastic optimal control''. It is written using the Julia language, which can be installed from here: [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/), or paste this in your terminal (mac/linux) ```curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh```

If you're new to Julia, upon cloning the code, open a terminal within the corresponding directory, then visit the quick tutorial here [https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-project-environments-in-julia-ec8ae73afe9c](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-project-environments-in-julia-ec8ae73afe9c).
