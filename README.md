# linearizing-uncertainty-for-control
This code can be used to reproduce the results in our paper ``Extended Kalman filter---Koopman operator for tractable stochastic optimal control''. It is written using the Julia language, which can be installed from here: [https://julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/), or ```curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh```.

Upon cloning the code, open a terminal within the corresponding directory, type ```julia``` to run the julia REPL and then type ```] instantiate``` to install the required packages.
